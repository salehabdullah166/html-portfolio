  <h1>Best movies that were ever made</h1>
  <h2>My list of top 3 movies</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
  <p>Alot of life lessons in this movie like working hard, staying consistent and working in silence.</p>

  <h3>12 years a slave</h3>
  <p>Unlike the previous movie there isn't a lot of lessons in this movie but it is an interesting movie plus it takes you back in time.</p>

  <h3>Kingdom of Paradise</h3>
  <p>I like this movie because it is based on an historical event i.e. the conquest of Jerusalem.</p>
